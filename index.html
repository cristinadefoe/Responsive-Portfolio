            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <img src="assets/images/Cristina-Defoe.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Cristina Defoe" class="profile-image">

            <p>Accomplished, results-driven professional with over 10 years of experience in diverse industries; semiconductor,
                RFID and LED. Possess Bachelorâ€™s Degrees in Business Management and Computer Engineering. Dedicated leader
                known for strong program management skills, technical expertise and customer-focused experience.</p>

            <p>As a Global Sales Development Manager at Philips Lumileds, I managed the LED sales development activities for
                flash and display market with an annual revenue of over $600 million.</p>

            <p>After moving to Colorado, I took a break from working and made lifestyle changes by focusing on my well being
                instead of my career. Nowadays, I spend my time going to yoga classes, trying to learn how to meditate and
                spending time with with my family. I love interior decorating shows and reading articles about it and use
                the ideas I learn to decorate our new home.</p>

            <p>However, there are times when I miss the fast-paced life in Silicon Valley. My goal is to channel my energy in
                our web development class - looking forward to learning and growing in the next few months!</p>
